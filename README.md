# 🐍 Python Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Python mini projects**! These simple and fun projects are built to help me learn and practice Python programming.

Each project is beginner-friendly and showcases core concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and file handling. More advanced features like modules and object-oriented programming may appear in later projects.
This is not an well organised list.

# 🤖 MoodBot - Python ChatBot

**MoodBot** is a beginner-friendly Python script that asks the user how they're feeling and responds with a message based on their mood.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **Strings:** The user input is captured as a string and compared to mood options.
- **`if-elif-else`:** Conditional statements are used to determine which message to print based on the mood entered.
- **`input()` function:** To capture user interaction via the terminal.
- **`.lower()` method:** To make the input case-insensitive, allowing flexibility like "Happy", "HAPPY", or "happy".

## 💻 How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the file:
   ```bash
   python mood_bot.py
